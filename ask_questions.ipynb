      "\n",
      "### Credit Card:\n",
      "1. **Borrowed Funds**: When you use a credit card, you are borrowing money from the card issuer up to a certain limit. You will need to pay back this amount, usually with interest if not paid in full by the due date.\n",
      "2. **Credit Score Impact**: Using a credit card responsibly can help build your credit score. Late payments or high balances can negatively impact your credit score.\n",
      "3. **Rewards and Perks**: Many credit cards offer rewards such as cash back, travel points, or other perks.\n",
      "4. **Interest and Fees**: If you do not pay off your balance in full each month, you will incur interest charges. There may also be annual fees, late payment fees, and other charges.\n",
      "5. **Fraud Protection**: Credit cards generally offer strong fraud protection, and you are typically not liable for unauthorized charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Debit Card:\n",
      "1. **Own Funds**: When you use a debit card, the money is directly withdrawn from your checking account. You are using your own funds, not borrowing.\n",
      "2. **No Impact on Credit Score**: Using a debit card does not affect your credit score since you are not borrowing money.\n",
      "3. **Limited Rewards**: Debit cards usually do not offer the same level of rewards or perks as credit cards.\n",
      "4. **No Interest**: Since you are using your own money, there are no interest charges. However, there may be overdraft fees if you spend more than what is in your account.\n",
      "5. **Fraud Protection**: Debit cards also offer fraud protection, but the process to recover funds can be slower compared to credit cards.\n",
